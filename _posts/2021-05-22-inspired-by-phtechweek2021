I do not remember what exactly led me to attend this conference. It must have been over a decade since the last time I attended a geek conference, and that was back when I was still a developer. I was very active in the Microsoft Communities and met some really amazing people there. People that I still connect with to this day.

For some reason, my move from development to testing made me stop going to these communities. Back then, test automation was still in its infancy and testers were not really considered geeks. In fact, some did not even feel the work that we did was technical. 

Anyway, I kept the relationships but pretty much avoided the communities. 

For some reason, their email invitation found its way into my Inbox and I clicked Register.

I'mglad I did.

#### Takeaways

I learned a lot of things, both technical and non-technical skills. 

My biggest takeaway was becoming aware of the different communities that are out there and reigniting the fire to be active again. I saw the passion in the people organizing, speaking and attending the activitiy and I was just inspired. Inspired to do my share once more.

I may not be the biggest geek out here but that's ok, because this is not about me. This is about what I can bring to the table to help others succeed and be better. 

This is just an extension of my coaching mission, to unleash the superpower that lies in all of us.
