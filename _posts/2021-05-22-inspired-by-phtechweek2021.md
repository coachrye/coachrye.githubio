I don't remember what exactly led me to attend this conference. 

It must have been over a decade since the last time I attended a geek conference, that was back when I was still a developer. 

I was very active in the Microsoft Communities and met some really amazing people there. People that I still connect with to this day.

For some reason, my move from development to testing made me stop going to these communities. You see, back then, testers were not really seen as part of the geek community. Some people even thought that "anybody can test." Not everyone, but a lot did. In fact, it was very common to hear someone sayt, "Oh, he's not a good developer. Just put him in testing." Something that 

Besides, test automation was still in its infancy too, so we had no way to show our geeky side. 

Anyway, this is not about that. I don't plan on getting into the details. 

Besides, it was all good. Although I became inactive, I was able to keep the relationships.

Fast forward to two weeks ago and, for some reason, their email invitation found its way into my Inbox. I usually ignore these conferences but, again for some reason, I clicked **Register**.

I'm glad I did.

### Takeaways

I learned a lot of things, both technical and non-technical skills. 

However, thoese were not my biggest takeaway. 

It was the awareness of the different volunteers who are out there trying to improve the Philippine tech community, and this reignited the fire to be volunteer again. I saw the passion in the people organizing, speaking and attending the activitiy and I was just inspired. Inspired to do my share once more.

I may not be the biggest geek out here but that's ok, because this is not about me. This is about what I can bring to the table to help others succeed and be better. 

Come to think of it, this is just an extension of my coaching mission, to unleash the superpower that lies in all of us.
